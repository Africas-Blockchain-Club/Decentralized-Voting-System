# Decentralized Voting System

## Description

The Decentralized Voting System is a technological solution designed to ensure the integrity, security, and privacy of the voting process without relying on a central authority. Leveraging blockchain technology, cryptographic techniques, and decentralized networks, it ensures the integrity, privacy, and accessibility of the voting process.

This system utilizes smart contracts and is built using Visual Studio Code (VSCode). You'll need to install extensions like Solidity for smart contract development. Node.js and npm are also required for running the project.

Users are required to connect to their wallet, which serves as their unique ID for voter registration. The system includes the following pages: landing page, register, login, view ballot, and cast the vote page, in that order.
